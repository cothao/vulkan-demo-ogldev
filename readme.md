TODO:

- Currently there is an issue with the compute pipeline. After I fixed an issue with the model pipeline, the compute seemed to stop working. I tried removing the model pipeline code and it's still having issues. The code is currently in a state where the model pipeline code is disabled and I am trying to isolate the issue with just the original graphics pipeline and the compute pipeline
